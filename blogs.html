            <p class="blog" style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 1vw;"><span id="before">This blog is about the education system in India. It's about how it's all wrong, and not a good education system. Well, the first thing that is wrong with it is that it isn’t useful. Let me explain</span><span id="dots">..</span><span id="more">I don't see many people using the irrelevant information that they teach in the real world. No one needs to know geography, or history in detail. It's not useful. The syllabus needs to be better. There's a quote that says that education never goes to waste, but well, it does. Let's start with an example. Say I wanna become a web developer, get a job in a company with a handsome salary. Well, companies don't have time to look for actual talent, or so I've been told. They look at your class 10th mark sheet, and then your class 12th mark sheet, and if you didn't pass class 12th, they won’t even consider you as a potential employee. Now, I don't really know how much of this is true, companies could be evolving or changing. But the adults around us, our parents and our teachers tell us that companies give a lot of importance to marks.<br><br>
                After your grade 11th and 12th, you have to do engineering where you'll learn a bunch of computer science languages, how machines work and stuff, and then after learning that, you get the job. The problem is that grades 11th and 12th are completely useless. Now I am learning about electrochemistry and apparently that will help me become a web developer. Say I want to make mobile applications, or do anything other than become some sort of a scientist or a mathematician. In that case, learning electrochemistry doesn't help me at all. Or anyone for that matter. Let us say that you wish to become an eye doctor. Sorry, but you need to learn how to draw Circuits, find Current and Voltage. But the government already tells doctors how much electricity they have used. They don’t need to know all this. <br><br>
                Then we come to the topic of degrees, those are good in certain cases. A person aspiring to become a web developer will benefit from getting a degree in web development. It will actually give you that required knowledge. But why do potential web developers have to learn electrochemistry and atom bonding? To do this is utterly useless. I passed out of 10th grade, but I honestly think that the syllabus was pretty useless and forgettable. I didn't really need to know a lot of the things they taught. The education system could equip us with the information and skills we need to survive in this world as an adult- but they don’t. I forgot most of the syllabus, and so did a lot of people after every passing year of school.<br><br>
                So if you are stressed over your class, if you are under performing or you can't focus because you don't want to do it, then don't sweat it. The system is flawed and if you have talent, then you can get through. GPA's or marks are overrated. I'll leave you with a few quotes-<br><br>
                "One of the things we’ve seen from all our data crunching is that GPAs are worthless as criteria for hiring, and test scores are worthless. After two or three years, your ability to perform at Google is completely unrelated to how you performed when you were in school, because the skills you required in college are very different."- Laslo Book, Google's SVP of HR.<br><br>
