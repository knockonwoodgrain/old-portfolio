            <p class="blog" style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0; text-align: justify; padding: 0.1vw;"><a href="https://kernel.org" class="linkcolor">Linux</a> is a kernel, but popularly reffered to as an operating system. A lot of open source operating systems are based on <a href="https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html" class="linkcolor">GNU</a> + Linux these operating systems are famous for their stability, and ironically, low marketshare.<p class="more" id="edumore"> What a lot of people don't know is that Android which is the most popular OS runs on the linux kernel, so do a lot of servers from big companies. There is a high chance that the windows iso download is from a linux server.<br><br>
                Stability:<br>
                Linux based operating systems are highly stable, and optimized, as they are open source, there is very little amount of bloatware in the OS. Unlike Windows, these operating systems or distributions as they are called do not share your personal data as telemetry, which is why even very old hardware can run linux easily, even the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" class="linkcolor">Rasberry Pi</a> can runs a linux distribution. A huge reason why Linux is used for servers is because it can update in realtime without any need to restart, it is highly stable and light, and can be modified to any level by the companies that use them, and the distributions are free of cost. Unlike other operating systems, the linux distros can update their entire system without needing to restart, while windows has to restart everytime you install a new program, such that it works properly. Even Azure, microsoft's cloud computing services use linux based servers.<br><br>
                Security:<br>
                Linux is hugely known for it's security. Unlike Windows, linux has a better system for administrator access, so a lot of times you don't need it to do what you want, and if you do, you always need to put in the root password, while in windows you have to make a  new userprofile just for admin purposes. Many distros come with a package manager, which makes installing programs a lot easier, you do not have to go to the website and download executable binaries to install programs, you just have to type a sentence like "sudo apt install brave" in the terminal and it will install the program "brave" using the apt package manager with root(sudo) permissions, these programs are stored in secure repositories so this way installing malware even by mistake is quite difficult. Updating software is thus a lot more easier as it can be done with just one command, "sudo apt update". Because linux distros are used lesser, and by more experienced users, the amount of malware made for it is also much lesser.<br><br>
                Customizability:<br>
                Linux distributions are very highly customisable, a user can make their user interface look like whatever they want, it can look exactly like windows or, MacOs, or just their own custom UI. You can change desktop environments which basically changes how your UI looks, you can edit any UI element and modify it to your liking, without installing any extra programs. You can run custom shell scripts to do automated tasks such as download songs from a playlist on youtube to a specific folder. You can install libraries and scripts to make your PC look like whatever you want, the open source community makes a huge amount of custom themes, color schemes, Programs and they can be installed and used without any problem instantly. It is quite amazing how a user can do whatever they wish to do, many people start "ricing" or adding custom code to their configurations to suit their needs.<br><br>
                In conclusion, a lot of people can and should use Linux based distributions as their operating systems, all it takes is a few minutes and a USB stick. If you wanna try out linux, you should start with a quite popular distribution <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" class="linkcolor">Ubuntu.</a>

            <p class="blogheadingbl">Why everyone should use FOSS<button class="readmore" id="FOSSbutton" data-tilt data-tilt-glare="true" data-tilt-max-glare="0.11" data-tilt-scale="1.1">Read more</button></p>
            <p class="blog" style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0; text-align: justify; padding: 0.1vw;" >If you clicked on this then you probably know what Free and Open Source Sofware <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" class="linkcolor"> or FOSS</a> is and how amazing,customisable and community supported it is, if you don’t let me explain.<p class="more" id="FOSSmore">FOSS means Free and Open Source Software.Open source basically means that the code running the software is publicly available, anyone can modify it to their own liking or if authorised can change the official code to increase its functionality. Software used by  the majority of the public is closed source, let’s talk about a popularly used piece of software, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop.html" class="linkcolor">Adobe Photoshop</a>. The code that makes it work is only known by Adobe, which means that if someone finds a bug in the software they can’t find the code and fix the bug, they’ll instead have to report the bug to Adobe,and they might not even fix the bug which brings us to the first problem posed by closed source software, that is people can’t find and fix bugs on their own, everything is done by the company making the software and because there are only a limited amount of employes working at the company sometimes there are many bugs that aren’t fixed or even known, and even a person who could potentially fix it won’t be able to because the software can’t be modified. If vunerabilites or bugs are found in Open source software they are fixed quickly.<br><br>
                Another problem with closed source software is that mostly it’s paid and it’s costly, too costly .PHOTOSHOP COSTS  1675Rs PER MONTH. Which is why many people pirate closed source software for their devices which is illegal and immoral, and pirating software can also be highly unsafe.A valid point that can be raised is if people know how the code works, can’t they easily find vulnerabilities and exploit them. That doesn’t happen, there’s more good people than bad people, the software is continuously analysed and viewed by many people, hobbists, dedicated coders working to improve, people who just wanna mess around for fun, all of them can contribute to the software making it more secure, thus vunerabilites don't last for long and are found very quickly.<br><br>
                When closed source software isn't paid, it's a bigger problem, because they need some way to make money, if you the aren't then well you are the product. There's a popular and a very inaccurate quote "If you're not paying for the product, you're the product" Now that might be correct for closed source platforms like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" class="linkcolor">Meta</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" class="linkcolor">Google</a>, that use data and anyalytics to track the users for advertisements. A lot of times in these services, you have very little privacy, they have backdoors to all your private texts with other people, they track every post you like, how much time you spend looking at a post. A lot of people don't know that because while signing up, they agree with the terms and conditions without reading them. A company like meta has a very flexible ToS which allows them to take your data and use it to their liking. Open source software unlike that, cannot and will not do that, because it's open source and transparent. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" class="linkcolor">Windows 10</a>, there are advertisements in the start menu, it is filled with unneccesary bloatware and the telemetry continously sends data back and forth from their servers thus using precious resources and the users cannot know what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" class="linkcolor">Microsoft</a> is doing with that data.<br><br>
                It's amazing software, that doesn't get enough attention, because it isn't advertised, it doesn't need to be, it's just made, people who want to use it can use it, the only way most of the organisations get money is by donations. <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" class="linkcolor">GIMP</a> isn’t the only program that’s open source many programs are alternatives to their closed sourced versions, if you edit videos instead of Premiere Pro you can use <a href="https://shotcut.org/" class="linkcolor">Shotcut</a>, If you make 3d models, animate, make VFX, Rig characters, edit videos, texture all that can be done in <a href="https://blender.org" class="linkcolor">Blender</a>. Instead of Adobe Audition you can use <a href="https://tenacityaudio.org/" class="linkcolor">Tenacity</a>. Instead of FL studio or Ableton you can use <a href="https://lmms.io/" class="linkcolor">LMMS</a>. Instead of Adobe Illustrator you can use <a href="https://inkscape.org/" class="linkcolor">Inkscape</a>. The internet is filled with amazing open source software and communities, you just have to take the step.<br><br>
