                <p class="blog" style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0; text-align: justify; padding: 0.1vw;"><a href="https://kernel.org" class="linkcolor">Linux</a> is a kernel, but popularly reffered to as an operating system. A lot of open source operating systems are based on <a href="https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html" class="linkcolor">GNU</a> Linux these operating systems are famous for their stability, and ironically, low marketshare.<div class="more" id="edumore"> What a lot of people don't know is that Android which is the most popular OS runs on the linux kernel, so do a lot of servers from big companies.<br><br>
                Stability:<br>
                Linux based operating systems are highly stable, and optimized, as they are open source, there is very little amount of bloatware in the OS. Unlike Windows, these operating systems or distributions as they are called do not share your personal data as telemetry, which is why even very old hardware can run linux easily, even the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" class="linkcolor">Rasberry Pi</a> runs a linux distribution. A huge reason why Linux is used for servers is because it can update in realtime without needing to restart, some distributions are stable and light, and can be modified to any level.<br><br>
                Security:<br>
                Linux is hugely known for it's security. Linux has a better system for superuser access, so a lot of times you don't need it to do what you want, and if you do, you always need to put in the root password, while in windows you have to make a  new userprofile just for admin purposes. Many distros come with a package manager, which makes installing programs a lot easier, you do not have to go to the website and download executable binaries to install programs, you just have to type a sentence like "pacman -S firefox" in the terminal and it will install the program "firefox" using the pacman package manager, downloading from official repositories mean that they're confirmed safe. Updating software is thus a lot more easier as it can be done with just one command, "pacman -Syu". Because linux distros are used lesser, and by more experienced users, the amount of malware made for it is also much lesser.<br><br>
                Customizability:<br>
                Linux distributions are very highly customisable, a user can make their user interface look like whatever they want, it can look exactly like windows or, MacOs, or just their own custom UI. You can change desktop environments which basically changes how your UI looks, you can edit any UI element and modify it to your liking, without installing any extra programs. You can run custom shell scripts to do automated tasks such as download songs from a playlist on youtube to a specific folder. You can install libraries and scripts to make your PC look like whatever you want, the open source community makes a huge amount of custom themes, color schemes, Programs and they can be installed and used without any problem instantly. It is quite amazing how a user can do whatever they wish to do, many people start "ricing" or adding custom code to their configurations to suit their needs.<br><br>This is why I use linux, definitely not because my windows drive got corrupt and I had no other choice :sob:.(it's all cope)</a>

Precisely two days are enough. How you perceive yourself, going through multiple stages of processing a thought<div class="more" id="FOSSmore"> a few rides, not just money, bills to pay. Is it fun enough? Am I enjoying myself? Rhetorical questions, impossible to answer the moment they are asked, completely vanishing, deteriorating the point. Parched throat, fallen bottle 20 bucks, simply gone as i watched it go my attention completely grabbed by someone else at that place. Travelling throughout the journey itself was what I wasn't looking forward to,rather unanticipated, but that took the grandest amount of time. <br><br>There was a highlight where I was convinced, expectations aren't always met, in a good way. What you simulate in your mind is completely different than reality, and reality is wild. My fixation riveted towards a single span of the first day, when the time arrived, what I had anticipated was distinct from reality, nonetheless appreciated. I met a lot of crowd, but specifically two beautiful people, one I had never met, and one after a long time, little time spent. I was charmed by the city, it was truly one of the cities of all time.<br><br>
            Taking my first local bus ride for 10 instead of 13 because the conductor didn't have change. Traversing in the train,30, felt like it was a living creature, a monstrosity, thundering roars as it accelerated and decelerated, stopped for a short while and on the way again. It had it's own heart beat, throbbing throughout my body, or perhaps it was the anxiety of reaching my destination.
            <br><br>
After meeting my destination and parting ways, me and Rudra were back on it, Seawoodsdarave to ChurchGate. We boarded a fast train, labeled as C, and wanted to stop at Marine Lines, instead it slowed down, the noise on the train went down, and we prepared to get off it, except it wouldn't stop and the platform reached it's end. In a heartbeat Rudra decided to jump off the moving train, and I followed through, both of us didn't apprehend the speed, and fell down, lost balance, earned scratches, best memory I've had, followed by the best food I've tasted, followed by the best place in Mumbai.</p></div>
