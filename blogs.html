            <p class="blog" style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0; text-align: justify; padding: 0.1vw;">This blog is about the education system in India. It's about how it's all wrong, and not a good education system. Well, the first thing that is wrong with it is that it isn’t useful. Let me explain.<p class="more" id="edumore">I don't see many people using the irrelevant information that they teach in the real world. No one needs to know geography, or history in detail. It's not useful. The syllabus needs to be better. There's a quote that says that education never goes to waste, but well, it does. Let's start with an example. Say I wanna become a web developer, get a job in a company with a handsome salary. Well, companies don't have time to look for actual talent, or so I've been told. They look at your class 10th mark sheet, and then your class 12th mark sheet, and if you didn't pass class 12th, they won’t even consider you as a potential employee. Now, I don't really know how much of this is true, companies could be evolving or changing. But the adults around us, our parents and our teachers tell us that companies give a lot of importance to marks.<br><br>
                After your grade 11th and 12th, you have to do engineering where you'll learn a bunch of computer science languages, how machines work and stuff, and then after learning that, you get the job. The problem is that grades 11th and 12th are completely useless. Now I am learning about electrochemistry and apparently that will help me become a web developer. Say I want to make mobile applications, or do anything other than become some sort of a scientist or a mathematician. In that case, learning electrochemistry doesn't help me at all. Or anyone for that matter. Let us say that you wish to become an eye doctor. Sorry, but you need to learn how to draw Circuits, find Current and Voltage. But the government already tells doctors how much electricity they have used. They don’t need to know all this. <br><br>
                Then we come to the topic of degrees, those are good in certain cases. A person aspiring to become a web developer will benefit from getting a degree in web development. It will actually give you that required knowledge. But why do potential web developers have to learn electrochemistry and atom bonding? To do this is utterly useless. I passed out of 10th grade, but I honestly think that the syllabus was pretty useless and forgettable. I didn't really need to know a lot of the things they taught. The education system could equip us with the information and skills we need to survive in this world as an adult- but they don’t. I forgot most of the syllabus, and so did a lot of people after every passing year of school.<br><br>
                So if you are stressed over your class, if you are under performing or you can't focus because you don't want to do it, then don't sweat it. The system is flawed and if you have talent, then you can get through. GPA's or marks are overrated. I'll leave you with a few quotes-<br><br>
                "One of the things we’ve seen from all our data crunching is that GPAs are worthless as criteria for hiring, and test scores are worthless. After two or three years, your ability to perform at Google is completely unrelated to how you performed when you were in school, because the skills you required in college are very different."- Laslo Book, Google's SVP of HR.<br><br>
                "Tomorrow is my exam but I don't care Because A Single Sheet of Paper Can't Decide My Future" - Thomas A  Edison.

            <p class="blogheading">Why everyone should use FOSS<button class="readmore" id="FOSSbutton" data-tilt data-tilt-glare="true" data-tilt-max-glare="0.11" data-tilt-scale="1.1">Read more</button></p>
            <p class="blog" style="margin-top: 0;margin-bottom: 0; text-align: justify; padding: 0.1vw;" >If you clicked on this then you probably know what Free and Open Source Sofware or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" class="linkcolor">FOSS</a> is and how amazing,customisable and community supported it is, if you don’t let me explain.<p class="more" id="FOSSmore">FOSS means Free and Open Source Software. It is software that is free to use and open source. Open source basically means that the code running the software is publicly available, anyone can modify it to their own liking or if authorised can change the actual code to increase its functionality. Usually software used by  the majority of the public is closed source, let’s talk about a popularly used piece of software, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/in/products/photoshop.html" class="linkcolor">Adobe Photoshop</a>. The code that makes the software work is only known by <a href="https://www.adobe.com/" class="linkcolor">Adobe</a>, which means that if someone finds a bug or glitch in the software they can’t find the misbehaving code and fix the bug, they’ll instead have to report the bug to Adobe, who might or might not fix the bug, which brings us to the first problem posed by closed source software, that is people can’t find and fix bugs on their own, everything is done by the company making the software and because there are only a limited amount of employes working at the company sometimes there are many bugs that aren’t fixed or even known, and even a person who could potentially fix it won’t be able to because the software can’t be modified. Thus Open Source software has Very less or almost No Bugs.<br><br>
                Let’s consider photoshop once again. If you have used it, you would know that Photoshop is not very fast or snappy, it is a “heavy” piece of software, It requires about 2 Gigabytes of space and it’s prone to crashing. On the other hand the Open Source software “alternative” to photoshop is <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" class="linkcolor">GIMP(GNU Image Manipulation Program)</a>, only takes up 200 megabytes of space, it is also available on linux and it’s very fast, it has less bugs and does almost everything that photoshop can. Open Source software is Lighter and More optimised to work on more devices.<br><br>
                Another problem with closed source software is that mostly it’s pad and it’s costly, too costly .FUCKING PHOTOSHOP COSTS  1675Rs PER MONTH HOLY SHIT, THAT’S COSTLIER THAN <a href="https://netflix.com" class="linkcolor">NETFLIX</a>. Which is why many people pirate closed source software for their devices which is illegal and a bad thing to do, and it can also be highly unsafe if not done correctly. On the other hand GIMP is literally free, and it's better, it's so much better. use GIMP. It's better, “Industry standard” doesn’t mean shit, it’s just a tool.<br><br>
                I personally use GIMP and it's very similar to photoshop. Now you might say, hey if people know how the code works, can’t they easily find vulnerabilities and exploit them. That doesn’t happen, there’s more good people than bad people, the software is continuously analysed and viewed by many people, hobbists, dedicated coders working to improve, people who just wanna mess around for fun, all of them can contribute to the software making it more secure, thus it's very difficult to hack.<br><br>
                Hey if it's so great why don’t many people use it?Because it isn't advertised, it doesn't need to be, it's just made, people who want to use it can use it, the only way most of the organisations get money is by donations. GIMP isn’t the only program that’s open source many programs are alternatives to their closed sourced versions, if you edit videos instead of Premiere Pro you can use <a href="https://shotcut.org/" class="linkcolor">Shotcut</a>, If you make 3d models, animate, make VFX, Rig characters, edit videos, texture all that can be done in <a href="https://blender.org" class="linkcolor">Blender</a>. Blender is amazing, it's really good it rarely crashes. Instead of Adobe Audition you can use <a href="https://tenacityaudio.org/" class="linkcolor">Tenacity</a>. Instead of FL studio or Ableton you can use <a href="https://lmms.io/" class="linkcolor">LMMS</a>. Instead of Adobe Illustrator you can use <a href="https://inkscape.org/" class="linkcolor">Inkscape</a>. The conclusion is Adobe is Trash.<br><br>
